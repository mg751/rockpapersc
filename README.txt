Outline for rock paper scissors.

A. Create function for computer to
return rock, paper or scissors at random.
    1. Create variable result to store randomly generated
    rock paper or scissors
    2. Create function to generate random number between 0
    and 1. If it's less than 0.3333, then rock, if it's between
    0.3333 and 0.66666, then paper, otherwise scissors.
    3. Create function that returns result (variable) of
    the above random calculation

B. Create function to compare user input to computer result.
    1. Create parameter for user input that converts input
    to string and all lower case.
    2. If user input does not match "rock, paper or scissors"
    break function and return error.
    3. Within function, perform equality check from user 
    input to computer result.
    4. If user input matches computer result, return match
    string
    5. If user input is rock and cResult is paper ...
    6. If user input is rock and cResult is scissors ...
    7. Return  

C. Rounds. 
    1. Create function that calls game() function for an X 
    number of times
    2. I got lazy and started experimenting rather than writing
